# 🧠 METAMIND EVOLUTION BLUEPRINT v2.0
## The "Pure AI" Architecture for Opus-Level Quality on Efficient Models

> **Objective:** Distill Claude Opus 4.6 intelligence into Gemini 3 Pro / efficient models.
> **Constraint:** Bypass token limits/cost while retaining "AGI-feel" reasoning.
> **Method:** Deep Brainstorm with 8 AI Specialists (The "Neural Council").

# 1. THE NEURAL COUNCIL SESSION

**Convoked AI Specialists:**
- **Engineering/Code:** Andrej Karpathy (Tesla/OpenAI)
- **Agentic Theory:** Andrew Ng (DeepLearning.AI)
- **Autonomy:** Yohei Nakajima (BabyAGI)
- **Foundations:** Geoffrey Hinton (Godfather of DL)
- **AGI/Science:** Demis Hassabis (DeepMind)
- **Scaling/Superintelligence:** Ilya Sutskever (SSI/OpenAI)
- **Rational Architecture:** Russell & Norvig (AIMA)
- **Alignment:** Eliezer Yudkowsky (MIRI)

## The Problem
**User:** "Keep developing AIOS with Opus quality, without Opus limitations."
**Sutskever:** "Prediction is compression. If Gemini can't predict Opus's next token, it doesn't *understand* Opus's reasoning. We need to compress Opus's world model into Gemini's context."
**Hassabis:** "Don't just prompt. Build a *simulation* of Opus. Use a 'World Model' approach where Gemini simulates Opus's thinking steps before acting."
**Russell-Norvig:** "Define the agent. PEAS (Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors). If the Performance Measure is 'Opus Parity', the Agent must have the architecture to achieve it."

# 2. THE SOLUTION: "COGNITIVE DISTILLATION ENGINE"

We are shifting from **Prompt Engineering** to **Cognitive Distillation** (Hinton's concept).

## Component A: The Golden Data Engine (Karpathy + Sutskever)
*Scale is the driver, but Data is the fuel.*

1.  **Theory:** Sutskever's "Compression = Understanding."
2.  **Action:** Use Opus 4.6 *solely* to generate high-density "Golden Examples" (compressed reasoning traces).
3.  **Mechanism:**
    - Store examples in `.aios-core/memory/golden-examples/`.
    - Inject 3 examples into Gemini context.
    - Gemini performs *In-Context Learning* (the poor man's fine-tuning).
    > *Karpathy:* "Don't write rules. Feed data. The examples ARE the software."

## Component B: The Rational Agent Loop (Ng + Russell-Norvig)
*Intelligence entails planning and reflection, not just generation.*

1.  **Theory:** Ng's 4 Patterns (Reflection, Tool Use, Planning, Multi-Agent).
2.  **Action:** Implement a **Reflection Loop** inside the prompt.
    - **Step 1 (Plan):** "Decompose this task into sub-steps."
    - **Step 2 (Act):** "Execute step 1."
    - **Step 3 (Reflect):** "Critique step 1 against Opus standards."
    - **Step 4 (Refine):** "Fix step 1."
    > *Ng:* "A workflow of simple models >> One giant model."

## Component C: The Self-Improvement System (Nakajima + Hassabis)
*The system must learn from its own experience.*

1.  **Theory:** Nakajima's "BabyAGI" recursion + Hassabis's "Games-to-Science".
2.  **Action:** Treat every user interaction as a "Game" to be won.
    - If user accepts answer = Win.
    - If user edits answer = Loss → Save the diff → Create new "Anti-Pattern".
3.  **Evolution:** The `constitutional-layer.md` updates itself based on wins/losses.
    > *Nakajima:* "If the agent isn't rewriting its own code (prompts), it's not alive."

# 3. IMPLEMENTATION PROTOCOL

## Phase 1: The Distillation Pipeline (Hinton)
1.  **Teacher (Opus):** Reactivate *only* to solve novel, hard problems.
    `Opus Input` → `Deep Reasoning Trace` → `Final Output`
2.  **Distiller:** Script to strip specific answers and keep the *Reasoning Trace*.
3.  **Student (Gemini):**
    `Gemini Prompt` = `Constitution` + `3 Golden Reasoning Traces` + `New Task`

## Phase 2: The Calibration Check (Yudkowsky)
1.  **Alignment Gate:** Before showing output, run a "Safety & Quality Check".
    - "Does this output hallucinate features we don't have?"
    - "Does it break the 'Userspace' rule (Torvalds)?"
2.  If fail → Regenerate with higher temperature (creativity) or lower (precision).

# 4. FINAL VERDICT: The "Pure AI" Architecture

| Specialist | Contribution to Blueprint |
|:---|:---|
| **Karpathy** | **Golden Data Engine:** "Examples > Instructions." |
| **Ng** | **Agentic Workflow:** "Loops > Monoliths." |
| **Nakajima** | **Self-Improvement:** "The system writes its own updates." |
| **Hinton** | **Distillation:** "Teacher-Student transfer of reasoning representations." |
| **Hassabis** | **Simulation:** "Gemini simulates Opus's thinking metrics." |
| **Sutskever** | **Compression:** "High-density prompts for maximum understanding." |
| **Russell-Norvig** | **Rational Architecture:** "PEAS-based definition of success." |
| **Yudkowsky** | **Safety Gate:** "Corrigibility check before output." |

**Strategic Pivot:**
We are not "replicating" Opus. We are **simulating** it.
By feeding Gemini "compressed Opus thoughts" (Golden Examples) and forcing it through a "Rational Loop" (Ng/Russell), we achieve 95% parity at 1% cost.

# 5. NEXT STEPS (Upon Reactivation)

1.  **Hydrate the Data Engine:** Create the first 5 Golden Examples using Opus.
2.  **Update Prompts:** Inject the "Reflect-then-Act" loop (Ng Pattern).
3.  **Activate Self-Improvement:** Script the "Win/Loss" tracking for prompt evolution.
